# Adithya Ravi - Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Adithya Ravi, a 23-year-old graduate student at **[Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu), South Carolina, USA**, who has earned his bachelor degree in Computer Science & Engineering from **[Easwari Engineering College](https://srmeaswari.ac.in), Tamil Nadu, India** and is a software and technology enthusiast with a mind full of dreams. I am committed towards teamwork and problem-solving through a goal-oriented approach. I'm keen to learn new skills and broaden my knowledge so that I could confidently apply them later in my career. Fun fact: I am a dog lover and spend most of my free time on Reddit or editing short video montages.  

This is to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### [Online Aid For Detecting Brain Tumor And Tuberculosis Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online-aid-bt_tb)
**Code:** [`index.html`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/online-aid-bt_tb)    
**Description:** A online web application with a trained CNN model detects the existence of a brain tumor or tuberculosis using photographs of the patient's x-ray and MRI scan.  
**Technology:** Python, HTML, Materialize CSS, JavaScript  
**Results:** A basic interface that is self explanatory allowing users to navigate with no difficulty and the model generates a report reading the image from the user.   

### [Restaurant Tip Calculator using JavaScript](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/tip-calc)
**Code:** [`index.html`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/tip-calc)     
**Description:** A simple restaurant tip calculator that calculates the tip based on the specified percentage and displays the adjusted cost. It can also take a snapshot and save it as a pdf file using the screenshot button.       
**Technology:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript     
**Results:** The screenshot pdf is saved in the downloads folder with the date of updation as the file name.  

### [Differentiating Fake and Real News](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/fake-news)
**Code:** [`fake_news_detection.ipynb`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/fake-news/blob/main/fake_news_detection.ipynb)     
**Description:** A model is trained to recognize false and true news from the provided training dataset using Passive Aggressive Classifier from scikit learn, and predictions are made on the test dataset.       
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, TfidfVectorization, Passive Aggressive Classifier     
**Results:**   When the model is run, it creates a confusion matrix and reports the model's accuracy as well as other evaluation metrics.

### [Matrix code Scanner using Pyzbar package](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/code-scanner)
**Code:** [`code_type_detection.ipynb`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/code-scanner/blob/main/code_type_detection.ipynb)     
**Description:** Using opencv and pyzbar packages, python program is written so as to recognize the type of code that is being displayed on the screen and decode the data to a user-readable format and open links.       
**Technology:** Python, OpenCV, Pyzbar   
**Results:** The web cam is activated when the model is run. When a barcode/qr code is shown, it displays the data content and also recognizes the kind of code. The data content link is produced on the console, and clicking on it takes you to the desired location.

### [Mask Detection using OpenCV](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/mask-detection)
**Code:** [`mask-detetction.ipynb`](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/mask-detection/blob/main/mask-detetction.ipynb)    
**Description:** A online web application with a trained CNN model detects the existence of a brain tumor or tuberculosis using photographs of the patient's x-ray and MRI scan.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Tensorflow  
**Results:** The web cam is opened for real-time execution when the model is started. It identifies whether or not a person is wearing a mask and shows the status by mapping a rectangle around the person's face.

### [Heart Attack Prediction Using Multi-layer Perceptron Model](https://github.com/adithyaravi12/cpsc6430-machine-learning/blob/main/project5-final/Ravi_Adithya_P5.ipynb)
